# sms-active
This library provides the following features

- Sms active api allows you to get a number with the api and get the status of whether the verification code has arrived.
- If we don't have the type of number you want in stock, it waits until it arrives and returns the number information to you when you buy a number.
- You don't need to constantly check if you have received a verification code. It contains a function that checks the status until the verification code arrives and returns the code when it arrives.
- It allows you to cancel a number you have received, confirm that you have received the code, and receive another code for the same number for free.
- You can read your account balance.

npm i node-sms-active
